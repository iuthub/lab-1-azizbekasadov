I like learning foreign languages as well
as using them in daily life. It helps me
to communicate with other people and enha-
nce my knowledge, so that I improve my ski-
lls in practice. 
<hr/>
At this moment, I can speak 4 languages (on
different levels of course): - English, Ger-
man, Uzbek, Russian. And I am learning 2 
more: Portuguese and Korean. That makes me 
fun :)

I love programming, and especially mobile app
development. Since I have a Mac, I have got an
opportunity to learn and develop iOS and MacOS
apps for daily use. Therefore, I started to 
learn Swift language. 
<hr/>
Writing process on it is
having a lot of fun and pleasure. Syntax is pre-
tty and easy to learn and development area is good
