	It has been eight years since Batman (Christian Bale), 
	in collusion with Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), 
	vanished into the night. Assuming responsibility for the 
	death of Harvey Dent, Batman sacrificed everything for 
	what he and Gordon hoped would be the greater good. 
	However, the arrival of a cunning cat burglar (Anne 
	Hathaway) and a merciless terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy)
	force Batman out of exile and into a battle he may not 
	be able to win.

	Facing unemployment and his girlfriend's rejection, 
	writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is sure that he 
	has no future. That all changes when an old friend 
	gives him a drug that produces enhanced mental acuity. 
	Stoked on the untested chemical, Eddie rises to the 
	top of the financial world and attracts the attention 
	of a tycoon (Robert De Niro) who intends to use him to
	make a fortune. But terrible side-effects and a 
	dwindling supply threaten to collapse Eddie's 
	house of cards.

As a suicide survivor, demon hunter John Constantine 
(Keanu Reeves) has literally been to hell and back -
- and he knows that when he dies, he's got a one-way 
ticket to Satan's realm unless he can earn enough good-
will to climb God's stairway to heaven. While helping 
policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) investigate 
her identical twin's apparent suicide, Constantine becomes 
caught up in a supernatural plot involving both demonic 
and angelic forces. Based on the DC/Vertigo "Hellblazer" 
comics.
